# ItsYourRadio Website Test Report

## Summary
The testing of the ItsYourRadio website revealed several critical issues that prevent the application from functioning properly. The main issues are in both the frontend and backend components.

## Backend Testing

### API Endpoint Testing
- ✅ Root API endpoint (`/api/`) works correctly and returns the welcome message
- ❌ Auth endpoints (`/api/auth`) return 404 Not Found
- ❌ Users endpoints (`/api/users`) return 404 Not Found

### Database Connection Issues
- ❌ The backend is unable to connect to the MySQL database
- Error message: `Can't connect to MySQL server on 'BGY{Kzg7qu@localhost' ([Errno -2] Name or service not known)`
- This appears to be a configuration issue in the database connection string

## Frontend Testing

### React Application Issues
- ❌ The frontend application fails to load properly
- Error: `useContext is not defined` in the Home component
- The import statement in App.js is missing `useContext` from React imports
- Current import: `import { useEffect, useState, createContext, useRef } from "react";`
- Should include: `import { useEffect, useState, createContext, useRef, useContext } from "react";`

### Component Issues
- ❌ Home component fails to render due to the missing `useContext` import
- This prevents testing of all other functionality including:
  - Artists page
  - Podcasts page
  - Blog page
  - Media player functionality

## Recommendations

### Backend Fixes
1. Fix the database connection string in the backend configuration
2. Implement or fix the missing API endpoints for auth and users

### Frontend Fixes
1. Add `useContext` to the React imports in App.js
2. Test all components after fixing the import issue

## Conclusion
The application is currently non-functional due to both frontend and backend issues. The most critical issue is the React hook import problem in the frontend, which prevents the application from rendering at all. Once these issues are fixed, further testing can be conducted to verify the functionality of all features.
