Subject: [PATCH] Fix: Resolve react-scripts permission issue for deployment

This patch fixes the issue with react-scripts permission denied error
during deployment by modifying the build script in package.json to use
node directly.

Additionally, it updates the BrowserRouter import in App.js to use
react-router-dom instead of react-router.
